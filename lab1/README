The code is written in C++, and I have provided a makefile. I use a macbook though, so in lines 4 and 7
of the makefile, it's possible you will have to change clang++ to g++ in order to compile. The following 
"-std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++" may also need to be removed as I am unsure how it interacts with g++.

To run the code go into the lab1 directory in your console, and type make in the console.
Then the conventions follow the spec of the assignment, i.e.
         ./lab1.exe --fPath ./S5.txt --alg bfs
Then the code should run as expected. 

I was unable to fully implement IDS as it goes into an infinite loop. I think I was very close to having it
implemented but unfortunately could not figure out why it was not working.
